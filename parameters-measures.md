# Parameters to measure

* Temperature
* Rain quantity
* Humidity of air
* Solar radiation
* RSSI
* SNR
* Atmospheric pressure
* (To discuss) Wind speed and direction
* Airborne particulate matter
* (To discuss) Energy consumption of the end-device
* Time/timestamp


# Parameters that could be computed from measures

* Packet reception rate
* Packet error rate
* Gateway reception datarate
* (To discuss) Daytime/nighttime measures
* Week-end, working period, holidays
* Season of the year


# Outputs : how to represent the data (graph, stastitics, ...)

* Pearson correlation matrix
* RSSI as a function of the temperature, solar radiation, rain quantity, ...
* RSSI with different spreading factors
* Probability density function of RSSI/SNR values of the received frames, as reported by gateways
* (To discuss) Histogram of the used SF 
* RSSI as a function of the distance between the end-device and the gateway
* SNR as a function of the distance between the end-device and the gateway
