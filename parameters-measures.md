# Parameters to measure

* Temperature
* Rain quantity
* Humidity of air
* Solar radiation
* RSSI
* SNR
* Atmospheric pressure
* (To discuss) Wind speed and direction
* airborne particulate matter
* (To discuss) Energy consumption of the end-device


# Outputs : how to represent the data (graph, stastitics, ...)

* Pearson correlation matrix
* RSSI as a function of the temperature
* RSSI with different spreading factors
* Probability density function of RSSI/SNR values of the received frames, as reported by gateways
* (To discuss) Histogram of the used SF 
* RSSI as a function of the distance between the end-device and the gateway
* SNR as a function of the distance between the end-device and the gateway
* (To discuss) Packet error rate
