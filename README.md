# LoRa variability project

The objectives and learning outcomes of the project are defined at http://applications.umons.ac.be/web/en/pde/2018-2019/ue/UI-M1-IRELEC-104-M.htm.
The information hereunder don't replace or modify them in anyway.

## Main objective

In order to design a LoRaWAN network, a civil engineer must know which factors influence LoRa transmissions and which don't.
The objective of this project is to list these influencing factors and to prioritize them.

## Expected outcomes

* Describe the elements implied in a LoRaWAN transmissions.
* Describe the configuration parameters of LoRaWAN (spreading factor, channel, ...).
* Demonstrate a LoRaWAN transmission by building a simple object that sends an information periodically over LoRaWAN.
* Deploy many of these objects on a city scale.
* Collect LoRaWAN transmission data and display them over time on a real-time dashboard.
* Collect data about influencing factors from other sources (meteo, pollution, ...) and add them to the LoRaWAN transmission dashboard.
* Store collected data and make them easily available for data analysis.
* Determine the top X factors influencing the LoRaWAN transmission and present these influences graphically.
* Analyze the collected metrics and their precision.
* Adapt the emitting object and the data collection process to improve the analysis.
* Write a scientific article, following the IEEE article template, that summarizes the project and its findings.
* Present orally a summary of the project and its findings.
