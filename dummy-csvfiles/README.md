# Goal of this folder
The purpose of this folder is to put all the csv files that will be used for training (graphs and other statistics). 
The "first-drafts" folder contains the very first csv files that were created (along with the python script) that were used for testing python functions. They will most likely not receive any further updates.
These drafts are just there for the "history" of the work.
